# My Manager README
Welcome to my readme, I am glad you are here. I hope this information helps us to work more effectively together.

# About Me
I am an athlete, adventure-seeker and I love traveling. I grew up in Iran, lived in the Uk for six years and then moved to the US. I am proud to call these three countries my home.

Weekends or after work you can find me:

- In nature running, cycling, swimming or skiing.
- Traveling.
- Attending a conference/meet-up.
- Spending time with friends, colleagues or family.
- Sitting in a coffee shop and reading/learning & trying to be better at what I do.
- Checking things off my bucket list.

I love good food, but good company is more important to me. I only cook Persian food if I have more than six friends over especially if it is [Ghormeh Sabzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghormeh_sabzi).


# Work-Life Balance

I am a big believer of work-life balance, it is hard to respond to emails or slack messages when I am skiing, cycling or traveling outside of work hours(~0800 to ~1800).

If it is urgent, feel free to call me anytime.

I do not expect my team to work during the weekend or respond to my messages.

All of this is just for me contacting you, not being on-call or being paged for production outages.

# My Team Values
- Respect and value diversity.
- Be approachable.
- Be an internal consultant and challenge existing decisions & process.
- Believe that everyone in the team does their best with the knowledge, abilities, and resources.
- Everyone has equal voice and vote regardless of their seniority.
- Follow team agreements:
  - Guidelines used by the team to describe how they want to work together.
  - We try to review our agreements quarterly or when we have a new team member join.
  - [Our current team agreements](teamAgreements.md).

Some team building sessions helped me in the past to know my team, their day to day challenges and motivations, sessions like:

- [Two truth and a lie](https://github.com/elhamrastkhadiv/orgtransformation/blob/master/offsite/sessions/Two%20truths%20and%20one%20lie.md)
- [The marketplace of skills](https://github.com/elhamrastkhadiv/orgtransformation/blob/master/offsite/sessions/Market%20Place%20of%20Skills.md)
